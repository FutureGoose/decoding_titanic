## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived or not using information like age, sex, passenger class, etc. We aim to achieve this by following a systematic workflow, from understanding the problem and exploring the data to building and evaluating a predictive model.

## Data Description

# Dataset Introduction

The Titanic dataset, imported from Seaborn, provides comprehensive details about the passengers who were aboard the ill-fated ship. This data, originally sourced from Kaggle, serves as a rich resource to understand various factors that might have influenced passenger survival. The dataset contains the following variables:

| Variable    | Description                                                     | Variable Type      |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `survived`  | 1 - survived, 0 - did not survive                              | Binary variable    |
| `pclass`    | Passenger class (1 - upper, 2 - middle, 3 - lower)              | Ordinal variable   |
| `sex`       | male, female                                                   | Categorical variable |
| `age`       | Passenger's age                                                 | Continuous variable |
| `sibsp`     | Number of siblings or spouses aboard                            | Discrete variable  |
| `parch`     | Number of parents or children aboard                            | Discrete variable  |
| `fare`      | Ticket fare                                                     | Continuous variable |
| `embarked`  | Port of embarkation (C - Cherbourg, Q - Queenstown, S - Southampton) | Categorical variable |
| `class`     | Passenger class (First, Second, Third)                          | Categorical variable |
| `who`       | 'man' - 18 years or older male, 'woman' - female, 'child' - under 18 years | Categorical variable |
| `adult_male` | 1 - if passenger is 18 years or older and male, 0 - otherwise   | Binary variable    |
| `deck`      | Ship deck where passenger's cabin was located                   | Categorical variable |
| `embark_town` | Town where passengers embarked                                 | Categorical variable |
| `alive`     | 'yes' - survived, 'no' - did not survive                       | Binary variable    |
| `alone`     | 1 - if passenger was travelling alone (no siblings/spouses/parents/children aboard), 0 - otherwise | Binary variable    |

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We performed an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's characteristics, identify patterns and relationships, and uncover any potential anomalies. This included visualizing the distribution of variables, examining the correlation between different variables, and more.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing stage involved cleaning the data (handling missing values, removing duplicates, etc.) and transforming the data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms. This included encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical variables, and more.

## Model Building

We experimented with several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to find the model that best predicts survival on the Titanic. We used cross-validation to ensure that our model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Evaluation

We evaluated our model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. We also looked at the confusion matrix to understand the types of errors our model was making.

## Conclusion

Our analysis revealed some interesting insights about survival on the Titanic and allowed us to build a predictive model with satisfactory performance.
