## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived or not using information like age, sex, passenger class, etc. We aim to achieve this by following a systematic workflow, from understanding the problem and exploring the data to building and evaluating a predictive model.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It includes information about the passengers on the Titanic, such as their age, sex, passenger class, fare, and whether they survived or not. For a detailed description of each field in the dataset, please refer to the [Data Dictionary](https://github.com/username/repo/blob/main/Data_Dictionary.md).

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We performed an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's characteristics, identify patterns and relationships, and uncover any potential anomalies. This included visualizing the distribution of variables, examining the correlation between different variables, and more.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing stage involved cleaning the data (handling missing values, removing duplicates, etc.) and transforming the data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms. This included encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical variables, and more.

## Model Building

We experimented with several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to find the model that best predicts survival on the Titanic. We used cross-validation to ensure that our model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Evaluation

We evaluated our model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. We also looked at the confusion matrix to understand the types of errors our model was making.

## Conclusion

Our analysis revealed some interesting insights about survival on the Titanic and allowed us to build a predictive model with satisfactory performance. For a detailed discussion of our findings and the limitations of our analysis, please refer to the [Conclusion](https://github.com/username/repo/blob/main/Conclusion.md) section.
